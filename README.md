This repository contains a script capable of constructing a circuit with components in `./data/configurations.json` the component types available are found at `./data/S_parameters`. 

To get a summary of the cascaded S-parameters of the circuit and the most dominant insertion loss component of the network, run `main.py`.

A notebook is also created as an example simulation of a chirp signal passing through the network, `rf_simulator.ipynb`.
